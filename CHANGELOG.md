## [Unreleased]

### Added

- CI (PHP 8.3/8.4) and tag-triggered release workflows; baseline release
  discipline (pest + phpstan via `composer test` / `composer analyse`). CI checks
  out the `subscription-core` sibling so the `../subscription-core` path
  dependency resolves.

## [0.1.1]

- Initial Filament admin UI layer for `subscription-core` (consumed by `aitehub`).
